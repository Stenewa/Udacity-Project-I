# PROGRAMMER: Stephanie Nelima Wanjala 
# DATE CREATED:06/01/2025
# REVISED DATE: 
# PURPOSE: Create a function print_results that prints the results statistics
#          from the results statistics dictionary (results_stats_dic). It 
#          should also allow the user to be able to print out cases of misclassified
#          dogs and cases of misclassified breeds of dog using the Results 
#          dictionary (results_dic).  
#         This function inputs:
#            -The results dictionary as results_dic within print_results 
#             function and results for the function call within main.
#            -The results statistics dictionary as results_stats_dic within 
#             print_results function and results_stats for the function call within main.
#            -The CNN model architecture as model wihtin print_results function
#             and in_arg.arch for the function call within main. 
#            -Prints Incorrectly Classified Dogs as print_incorrect_dogs within
#             print_results function and set as either boolean value True or 
#             False in the function call within main (defaults to False)
#            -Prints Incorrectly Classified Breeds as print_incorrect_breed within
#             print_results function and set as either boolean value True or 
#             False in the function call within main (defaults to False)
#         This function does not output anything other than printing a summary
#         of the final results.
##
# TODO 6: Define print_results function below, specifically replace the None
#       below by the function definition of the print_results function. 
#       Notice that this function doesn't to return anything because it  
#       prints a summary of the results using results_dic and results_stats_dic
#

    # TODO: 6a. REPLACE print("") with CODE that prints the text string 
    #          'N Not-Dog Images' and then the number of NOT-dog images 
    #          that's accessed by key 'n_notdogs_img' using dictionary

        #           in the results_stats_dic dictionary. Recall that all 
        #           percentages in results_stats_dic have 'keys' that start with 
        #           the letter p. You will need to write a conditional 
        #           statement that determines if the key starts with the letter
        #           'p' and then you want to use a print statement to print 
        #           both the key and the value. Remember the value is accessed 
        #           by results_stats_dic[key]
